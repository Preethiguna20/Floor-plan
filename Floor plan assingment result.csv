Kitchen,8,2,4,"The area of a rectangle (which a kitchen often is) is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.

Therefore, the area of the kitchen is:

4.0m * 2.0m = 8.0 square meters (m²)
"
Dining Area,14,4,3.5,"The area of a rectangle (like a typical dining area) is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.

In this case:

* **Length = 3.5 meters**
* **Width = 4.0 meters**

Therefore, the area of the dining area is:

3.5 meters * 4.0 meters = 14 square meters

The dining area is 14 square meters.
"
Living Area,55,5,11,"The area of a rectangular living area is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.

Therefore, the area is:  11.0m * 5.0m = 55.0 square meters (m²)
"
Bedroom 1,28,3.5,8,"The area of a rectangle (which we assume Bedroom 1 is) is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.

Therefore, the area of Bedroom 1 is:

8.0m * 3.5m = 28.0 square meters (m²)
"
Bedroom 2,12,3,4,"The area of a rectangle (which is the assumed shape of Bedroom 2) is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.

Therefore, the area of Bedroom 2 is 4.0m * 3.0m = 12.0 square meters (m²).
"
C.R.,2.25,1.5,1.5,"The area of a rectangle (like C.R. is assumed to be) is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.

Therefore, the area of C.R. is:

Area = length × width = 1.5m × 1.5m = 2.25 square meters (m²)
"
Porch,9,3,3,"The area of a porch with a length of 3.0 meters and a width of 3.0 meters is calculated using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

**Area = Length × Width**

Therefore, the area of the porch is:

Area = 3.0 m × 3.0 m = 9.0 square meters (m²)
